# G2ModelExtractor
Extracts models and model motion data from Grandia 2 files

## How to use
Make sure you have [python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) or newer installed for this to work. Make sure to tick the `Add to PATH` box at the start.
Once python is installed, move to `main.py` script to your `Grandia II Anniversary Edition` directory and run.
All models and motions parsed will be added to the `./models/` directory, names are based on the file they are read from and their index.
